Titanic Survival Prediction
This project analyzes and predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and more.

Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets used for binary classification problems. The dataset provides information on the passengers of the Titanic, such as their socio-economic status, age, gender, and survival status.

The objective is to:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.
Preprocess the data for machine learning.
Build and evaluate predictive models to classify passengers' survival.
Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster. It contains the following files:

train.csv: Training data used to train the model.
test.csv: Test data for predictions.
Features
Key features in the dataset:

Survived: Target variable (1 = Survived, 0 = Not Survived)
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Fare: Passenger fare
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, jupyter
Steps
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Run the notebook eda.ipynb to visualize and understand the dataset.

Preprocessing: Execute preprocessing.py to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

Model Training and Evaluation: Run model_training.py to train machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

Make Predictions: Use predict.py to generate survival predictions for new data.

Model and Approach
EDA:

Uncover trends such as survival rate by gender, class, and age groups.
Handle missing values in features like Age and Embarked.
Preprocessing:

Convert categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into numerical representations.
Normalize continuous features (e.g., Age, Fare).
Models:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
ROC-AUC Curve
Results
Best model: Random Forest
Accuracy: ~85%
ROC-AUC: 0.89
Note: Performance may vary based on feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
